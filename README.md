# Note-Taker
Using a functioning frontend source code, I will be connecting the backend for a note taker application!


## summary:
I was given the front end code for a non functioning note taker application and had to connect the back end (routes) to make the application functional. I did this by completing both the GET and POST requests. 

## Deployed Application:
